 Implementation-of-ZF-MMSE-receivers
 -----------------------------------

 Simulated MIMO system with ZF, LMMSE receiver and compared the results of BER vs SNR in MATLAB
Observation: A 2x2 MIMO system is mplemented and it is observed that the LMMSE receiver performs better than the ZF receiver at low SNR. But as SNR goes on increasing the difference between the two tends to zero.

Code and results are attached
